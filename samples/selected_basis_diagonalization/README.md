# A sample program for parallelized selected basis diagonalization

Sample code for computing the ground state of a quantum chemistry Hamiltonian based on sampled bitstrings representing alpha-spin orbitals.

This code assumes that alpha-spin and beta-spin orbitals share the same spatial basis. The Hilbert space is defined as the tensor product
of the alpha and beta spin sectors. The quantum chemistry Hamiltonian should be provided as a text file in FCIDUMP format.

- The alpha-spin orbital configuration is expected to be provided as a plain text file, with one bitstring per line (see AlphaDets.txt).
Each bitstring is ordered from right to left, meaning the rightmost bit corresponds to orbital 1, the next to orbital 2, and so on.
Note that the orbital labels correspond to the orbital indices defined in the FCIDUMP format described below.

- The FCIDUMP format is a commonly used quantum chemistry format that first lists two-electron integrals
$v_{ijkl} = \int d{\bf r}_1 d{\bf r}_2 \phi_i({\bf r}_1) \phi_k ({\bf r}_2) \vert {\bf r}_1 - {\bf r}_2 \vert^{-1} \phi_l ({\bf r}_2) \phi_j ({\bf r}_1)$
followed by one-electron integrals
$h_{ij} = \int d {\bf r} \phi_i ({\bf r}) \hat{h} \phi_j({\bf r})$.

For an example, see the `fcidump_Fe4S4.txt` file in the directory, which corresponds to an iron ion cluster.

- The ground state is computed using the Davidson algorithm. The calculation starts from an initial state in which all the weight is
placed on the product state corresponding to the first bitstring (after sorting) in `AlphaDets.txt`. In other words, the FCIDUMP file
is asssumed to define the basis in terms of molecular orbitals, and the initial state described above is regarded as the Hartree-Fock solution.

- For more details about the bitstring format used in `AlphaDets.txt` and the FCIDUMP file, please refer to the *User Guide* page generated by Doxygen.
You can generate the documentation by running the command `doxygen ./doc/Doxyfile` from the top level directory of this package.


## Requirement

- c++17
- OpenMP
- MPI
- BLAS and LAPACK

## Build

- Open the `Configuration` file and edit the environment variables according to your system: the compiler command (CCCOM), compiler options (CCFLAGS), and linker options (SYSLIB), and the path to the sbd library (SBD_PATH).

- After editing the configuration, run the make command to generate the executable:
    ```
    make
    ```

## Command-Line Arguments for Executable

For usage examples, please refer to the `run.sh` script included in this directory. It shows how to run the executable with various command-line options.

Below is an explanation of each command-line option.

- `--fcidump`: The name of the FCIDUMP file that defines the Hamiltonian integrals.
- `--adetfile`: The name of the file containing the set of determinants (bitstrings) for alpha-spin orbitals.
- `--loadname`: The name of the file containing the wavefunction data to load. If not specified, no loading is performed and the Hartreeâ€“Fock (HF) solution is used as the initial state.
- `--savename`: The name of the file in which to save the resulting wavefunction data. If not specified, the wavefunction is not saved.
- `--task_comm_size`: Specifies the size of the task communicator. This controls how the operations on the column indices of the Hamiltonian are distributed during matrix-vector multiplication.
- `--adet_comm_size`: The number of partitions for the set of determinants (bitstrings) corresponding to alpha-spin orbitals.
- `--bdet_comm_size`: The number of partitions for the set of determinants (bitstrings) corresponding to beta-spin orbitals.
- `--method`: When set to 0, the Hamiltonian is not stored explicitly and is applied to the wavefunction on-the-fly. When set to a nonzero value, the Hamiltonian matrix is stored to accelerate matrix-vector multiplication at the cost of higher memory usage.
- `--iteration`: The number of Davidson restarts to perform.
- `--block`: The maximum size of the subspace used in the Davidson method.
- `--tolerance`: Convergence threshold for the Davidson method. It determines the stopping criterion based on the norm of the residual vector.
- `--carryover_ratio`: The ratio of bitstrings with large wavefunction weights to be retained during the selection step.
- `--carryover_threshold`: A threshold value for selecting bitstrings with large wavefunction weights. Used only when `--carryover_ratio` is set to 0.
- `--shuffle`: Whether to shuffle the order of input half-determinants. If set to 0, no shuffling is performed; otherwise, the input is shuffled.
- `--rdm`: Whether to compute the 1-particle and 2-particle reduced density matrices (1pRDM and 2pRDM). If set to 0, they are not computed; otherwise, they are computed.
- `--bit_length`: Specifies the bit length handled by each size_t when representing bitstrings using `std::vector<size_t>`. The default value is 20.
